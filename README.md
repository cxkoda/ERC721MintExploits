# ERC721 Mint Exploits

A collection of the most common exploits used during ERC721 minting, together with a sample implementation for how they can be prevented.

The mock token implementation allows the mint of a single token to the message sender.
The tests check that exploit contracts can only mint one token per block (required to allow smart wallets to participate).
